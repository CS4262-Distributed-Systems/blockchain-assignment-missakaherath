* ### Smart contract

Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain. We can define how the transactions happen in smart contracts. Therefore a smart contract is considered as a transaction protocol too. They execute automatically when predetermined conditions are met.

* ### Consensus algorithm

A consensus algorithm is a process that defines a set of rules that determines how the nodes come to an agreement regarding transactions. The three main kinds of consensus algorithms in blockchains are Proof of Work (POW), Proof of Stake (POS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).
